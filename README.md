# SimpleBlog

## A small web app I built 
https://simple-blog100.herokuapp.com/ - The app is hosted on a hobby plan, so the first load might be slow if the server sleeps

### TechStack
React/Redux, Node.js, MySQL 

### Backlog
What could/should be added with more time?
- More tests (more unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests)
- Feature: Allow authors to save drafts
- Feature: Enable styling of posts and inserting of images/videos
- Feature: Read only for unauthenticated users
- Reponsive Styles
- Frontend-Optimization: Browser Caching, uglify, etc.

Anything else? - Let me know!
